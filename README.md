# Final-Recurrence
  Final Recurrence is an action game with captivating gameplay and impressive graphics, created by me and my colleague. I worked in a team to develop this project, me being in charge of gameplay programming, AI and some systems, and my colleague in charge of UI and other systems. The graphics were entirely created by me. The project lasted approximately 1 year, during which I worked intensively to complete it. We used technologies such as Unity, Blender and C# to create this game. Final Recurrence was my main project, where I gained valuable experience and proved my ability to work in a team and achieve my goals. I am passionate about games and I am looking for an opportunity to continue developing impressive projects in the field of games.
  Final Recurrence not only impressed with its gameplay and graphics, but also gained recognition in competitions. He won 1st place at the county Olympiad and won 3rd place at the national stage, proving the quality and level of difficulty of this project. This performance showed my ability to create high quality projects and to adapt to the requirements and standards of the competition. I am proud of this project and
